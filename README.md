## About SolarSupplyAu

Solar supply can come from photovoltaic (PV) generators on homes, busine- ses or large power stations. Solar and renewable energy is a growing market in Australia. The Aus- tralian Government Clean Energy Regulator writes in The Renewable Energy Target 2018 Administrative Report that the number of small and mid-size PV installations is increasing, and 86% of the 361 newly accredited power stations are solar PV. Because of this accelerating growth, it is therefore important to have access to current data on solar supply. Future planning and decisions depend on a good understanding of the current state of the solar landscape. For daily solar supply specifically, the Australian PV Institute (APVI) provides time-series data by postcode. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) provides funding to energy projects, including solar, and supports the APVI project. Itâ€™s important that the current state of solar supply is able to be visualised in an accessible way. This captures the rapid change as supply increases, and can be used to guide in future planning.
