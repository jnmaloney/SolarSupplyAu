The data processing unit takes input data about the current number of solar photovoltaic system installations per postcode, and estimates the performance daily based on weather reports. The visualisation unit allows the exploration of the dauily statistics from the national level down to each state and postcode. Postcode area visualisations are enhanced with a 3D rendering of the landscape and a representaion of the percentage of residences contributing to the solar supply.
